a efficient WheelView  based on RecyclerView, which is seay to use, and it can customed by yourself.

## Getting Started

First of all, this lib is base on androidx, *if your library do not migrate to android, there might be some problem* if you used this.

If you want to use this library, you should add those to your module's gradle

```
implementation 'cn.wongzhenyu:recyclerwheelview:0.0.3'
implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:XXX'
```

> Because recyclerwheelview have dependency of recyclerview(library of androidx), and to avoid the conflict of library version, I used compileonley to import recyclerview library, so you should add recyclerview by yourself.
