# RecyclerWheelView

An efficient WheelView  based on RecyclerView, which is easy to use, and it can customized by yourself.

## Getting Started

First of all, this lib is based on androidx, *if your library do not migrate to androidx, there might be some problems* if you used this.

If you want to use this library, you should add those to your module's gradle

```
implementation 'cn.wongzhenyu:recyclerwheelview:0.0.3'
implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:XXX'
```

> Because recyclerwheelview have dependency of recyclerview(library of androidx), and to avoid the conflicts of library version, I used compileonley to import recyclerview library, so you should add recyclerview by yourself.

## Result

there are two examples' results about recyclerwheelview in this project, if you used recyclerwheelview, you can  make this effect easily.

## end

Because of the pressure of workï¼Œ I do not have enough time to write document about how to use this library, you can see it in app module of this project, thinks for reading.
